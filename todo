1.averge case for binary search

Your tasks:
1. Perform a comparative analysis on the following two sorting algorithms.
a. Merge-sort
b. Quick-sort (last element as pivot)

2. Perform an analysis on the best, average, and worst case for binary search.

3. The analysis shall cover the following:
a. Theoretical analysis and experiment study
b. Time and space complexities

6. For the experiment study:
a. The running time captured should not include the time for I/O (reading input or printing output).
b. 10 or more input sizes should be captured.
c. Each member should run all sorting and searching algorithms using at least one language and include the results in the presentation slide.

7. Conclude the following:
a. Findings on sorting and searching algorithms in same language and different languages on same and different hardware.
b. The best sorting algorithm for the array based AVL implementation.
c. Compare theoretically the implementation of AVL using an array vs linked structure
